# Weather Forecast

## Description

This is a webpage that can be used to look up the weather forecast for a searched city.

To use this page, click on the box under "Search for a city:" and type in the name of a city. Then click on search. It brings up the current weather in the main box, as well as populates 5 smaller boxes with a five day forecast.

It also generates a gray box under the "search" button, with the name of the city you last searched for. When the page loads, it pulls in cities you searched for on previous visits to the page.

All of these gray boxes are clickable, and will bring up the weather information for whichever city name you clicked on.

## Tasks

For this project, I wasn't given any starter code. I did a little bit of HTML and CSS, but most of the work was in javascript. The majority of my time was spent learning how to use the API's and get information from them.

## What I Learned

The main take away from this project was working with API's. It seemed pretty overwhelming at first, but by the end of the project it was making a lot more sense. It is essentially a large array of objects.
